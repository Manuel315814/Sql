**Imagine you are a Data Analyst working at CVS Pharmacy, and you had access to pharmacy sales data. Use the BETWEEN SQL command to find data on medicines:

which sold between 100,000 units and 105,000 units
AND were manufactured by either Biogen, AbbVie, or Eli Lilly
Output the manufacturer name, drug name, and the # of units sold.

Hint: this problem requires not just BETWEEN, but also OR, AND, and WHERE clauses!

If you are struggling, be sure to review the old tutorials!***
SELECT manufacturer, drug, units_sold FROM pharmacy_sales WHERE units_sold BETWEEN 100000 AND 105000
AND (manufacturer = 'Biogen' OR manufacturer = 'AbbVie' OR manufacturer = 'Eli Lilly');
