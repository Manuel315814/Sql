***Let's practice using AND along with WHERE to filter Amazon reviews based on these two conditions:
   the start count is greater than 2, and less than or equal to 4
   the review must come from either user 123, 265, or 362
Pro Tip: Try coding up, and executing, each filtering condition, one at a time. It's too easy to try to code this all up in one go, and mess something up!***
SELECT * FROM reviews WHERE user_id=123 OR 
user_id=265 OR user_id=362 AND stars > 2 AND 
stars <=4;
