Let's practice using AND along with WHERE to filter Amazon reviews based on all 4 of these conditions:
the review should have 4 or more stars
the review ID is less than 6000
the review ID is more than 2000
the review can't come from user 142
Pro Tip: Try coding up, and executing, each command, one at a time. It's too easy to try to code this all up in one go, and mess something up!
SELECT * FROM reviews WHERE stars >=4 AND review_id < 6000 AND review_id > 2000 
AND user_id != 142;
